Adaptative Filtering Test #2
===

This repository is part of the [second test](Trabalho_prova_2.pdf) applied under the PhD class of Adaptative Filtering.

Requeriments:
> MATLAB 2009 or later.

## Install dependecies

The scripts were developed in MATLAB R2018b, in a Linux enviroment. Some divergions might occur, keep that in mind. Therefore, the main dependency is the [**kernel-tollbox**](code/kernelfiltering-toolbox). This is a repository open-sourced by Van Vaerenbergh and Santamar√≠a (2013) under the [link](https://github.com/steven2358/kafbox). For more information look into their repo.

1. Run `install.m` to add the toolbox folders to the path.
2. Type `savepath` to save the changes to the path.

## Run the codes

1. Run `prova_2_q1.m` it would output the most important figures;
2. Run `prova_2_q2.m` it would output the most important figures.
