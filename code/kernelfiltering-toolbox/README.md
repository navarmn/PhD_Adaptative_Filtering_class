Kernel Adaptive Filtering Toolbox
===

A Matlab benchmarking toolbox for kernel adaptive filtering. 

Kernel adaptive filters are online machine learning algorithms based on kernel methods. Typical applications include time-series prediction, nonlinear adaptive filtering, tracking and online learning for nonlinear regression. This toolbox includes algorithms, demos, and tools to compare their performance.

Directories included in the toolbox
---
`data/` - data sets

`demo/` - demos and test files

`doc/` - documentation

`lib/` - algorithm libraries and utilities

Setup
---

1. Run `install.m` to add the toolbox folders to the path.
2. Type `savepath` to save the changes to the path.


Octave / Matlab pre-2008a
-------------------------
This toolbox uses the `classdef` command which is not supported in Matlab pre-2008a and not yet in Octave. The older 0.x versions of this toolbox do not use `classdef` and can therefore be used with all versions of Matlab and Octave. http://sourceforge.net/projects/kafbox/files/

Usage
---
Each kernel adaptive filtering algorithm is implemented as a Matlab class. To use one, first define its options:
```matlab
options = struct('nu',1E-4,'kerneltype','gauss','kernelpar',32);
```
Next, create an instance of the filter. E.g., for an instance of the original KRLS algorithm run:
```matlab
kaf = krls(options);
```
One iteration of training is performed by feeding one input-output data pair to the filter:
```matlab
kaf.train(x,y);
```
The outputs for one or more test inputs are evaluated as follows:
```matlab
Y_test = kaf.evaluate(X_test);
```

Example: time-series prediction
---
Code from `demo/demo_prediction.m`
```matlab
% Demo: 1-step ahead prediction on Lorenz attractor time-series data
[X,Y] = kafbox_data(struct('file','lorenz.dat','embedding',6));

% make a kernel adaptive filter object of class krls with options: 
% ALD threshold 1E-4, Gaussian kernel, and kernel width 32
kaf = krls(struct('nu',1E-4,'kerneltype','gauss','kernelpar',32));

%% RUN ALGORITHM
N = size(X,1);
Y_est = zeros(N,1);
for i=1:N,
    if ~mod(i,floor(N/10)), fprintf('.'); end % progress indicator, 10 dots
    Y_est(i) = kaf.evaluate(X(i,:)); % predict the next output
    kaf.train(X(i,:),Y(i)); % train with one input-output pair
end
fprintf('\n');
SE = (Y-Y_est).^2; % test error

%% OUTPUT
fprintf('MSE after first 1000 samples: %.2fdB\n\n',10*log10(mean(SE(1001:end))));
```
Result:

    MSE after first 1000 samples: -40.17dB
